## Contributing 

### Prerequisites

Before working with our contributing to our AKS GitHub actions you should know a few concepts. Visit the links below for documentation.

- [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions)
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)

You also must have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and NPM installed.

### Contributions

First, fork the repository you are making a contribution to. Then, clone the repository locally. After the repository is local, create a new branch for your changes.

Run `npm install` to install dependencies the project needs. 

Make the changes to the project and add unit tests testing your changes. Make sure the unit tests work locally with `npm run test`. Then commit and push your changes to your remote fork.

Create a pull request from your fork against the main branch of the repository and get it merged in.
