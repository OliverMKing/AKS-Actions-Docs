# Usage

This page contains strong examples for how to use our actions. Our actions all have configuration options that can't be completely document here. You should view each action's repository for complete action-specific documentation. There's a complete list of our actions [here](../README.md#actions).

Most of our actions work for generic Kubernetes clusters and aren't tied to a specific cloud-provider or Azure.

## Starter Templates

The starter workflows provide the simplest examples. You can easily adopt them with these [steps](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/using-starter-workflows#using-starter-workflows).
